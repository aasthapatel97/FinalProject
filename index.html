<h1> Course 101: HAIKU  </h1>
    <p> Welcome to the course! In this short course, we’ll learn about about a special type of Japanese poetry called the 'Haiku'  </p>
      
      <p>We all have special moments in our lives. Perhaps it was the moment our child took his or her first steps, or said his or her first word. Perhaps it was the moment we were kissed for the first time, or the moment we took that high school diploma or college degree in our hands. Whatever those moments were, we captured them, in a photograph, a video, or simply with a poignant memory, so that we could recapture, and often share, the joy, the pride, the excitement; the emotional experience that made that moment special. Just as we capture a special moment in our lives, haiku poetry captures a moment in time, creating and sharing the joy, the wonder, and the perhaps profound emotional experience that exists within that moment.

Haiku is a form of poetry that focuses on a brief moment in time, and a sense of sudden illumination or enlightenment. A haiku is usually composed of seventeen syllables in three short lines. The first line often contains five syllables, the second line seven syllables, and the third line five syllables. A haiku is usually written in present tense, with a pause at the end of the first or second line, and it normally doesn't rhyme.
