    <h2> Steps for writing a HAIKU </h2>
    <p> Even though there are specific rules for writing a traditional haiku, the process can still be fun and rewarding. And remember that a modern haiku can be more freeform. </p>
     <ol>
       <li> Begin by reading examples of haiku - there are some below - to help you get inspired about the subjects and construction of haiku. A haiku is a beautiful form of poetry, so take time to appreciate it before you begin writing it. </li>
       <li> Create a list of possible subjects that you might write about, considering various aspects of nature that inspire you. Consider traditional subjects like animals, nature, and seasons, or something completely different. Even the smallest details can make for great haiku. </li>
       <li> After you choose a subject, you may want to look at a few pictures of it, or go outside and admire it. Like all of the great poets before you, some of the greatest inspiration comes from simply admiring nature and the world around them. </li>
       <li> Make a list of words that relate to the subject you have chosen. Be as descriptive as possible. Think about feelings and emotions too.</li>
       <li> The last line is usually used to make an observation about your subject. It can be fun to add a surprise here. Looking through the list you wrote, can you create an unexpected relationship between the first two lines and the third?</li>
       <li> Write using the 5-7-5 rule </li>
       
    </ol>
