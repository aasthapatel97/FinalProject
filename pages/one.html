   <p> A HAIKU (俳句 high-koo) is a short three-line poem that usually follows a 5-7-5 syllable structure. Haiku poetry was originally developed by Japanese poets, and is often inspired by nature, a moment of beauty, or a poignant experience. Haikus are meant to be read in one breath for resonance and impact.

  <p>   Haikus are meant to give the reader a brief sense of the subject using the senses. Think about how your subject smells, feels, sounds, tastes, and looks. Describe the subject using your senses so it comes alive for your reader and feels powerful on the page.
For example, you may write about the “musky scent of the pine needles” or the “bitter taste of the morning air.” If you are writing a haiku about a particular subject, such as your dog, you may describe the “clacking of its nails on the tile” or the “damp fur of wet dog.”.  To get a better sense of the genre, read haikus that are well known and considered good examples of the form. You can find examples in books or online. Read haikus that are about nature and other subjects. You may read:[4]
<ul>
  <li> Haikus by the Japanese poet Matsuo Basho.
  <li> Haikus by the Japanese poet Yosa Buson.
    </ul>
